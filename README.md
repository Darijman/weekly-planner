## Weekly-Planner - A planner that helps to remember all your tasks

Weekly-Planner is a simple planner that allows you to organize your weeks. It is built using:

- React
- TypeScript
- Css
- Nanoid (for id)

## ðŸ‘¾ Features

- Jump between dark-light modes.
- Add weeks and tasks.
- Sort tasks by finished status or by time, as you desire.
- Delete tasks and weeks.
- Edit tasks, their time and tasks title.
- Indication of which week you are currently in.

## ðŸ“’ Process

I started by creating dark-light mode. 

Then I added tasks and ability to delete it. 

I Also added the ability to sort tasks in the day. At first they're always sorted by time, you can also sort them by finished status.
They will be sorted by finished status at first, and their time as well.

Subsequently, I added 2 forms for editing task and creating task.

After that, I added a modal to confirm the deletion of a task or a week.

**NOTE:** The project's purpose is to test zustand and try to make dark-light mode.
